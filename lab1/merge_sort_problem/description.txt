-----Description----- 
This task requires implementing the merge sort algorithm in Lean 4. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides an array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. The function should take an array of integers and return a new array with the same elements sorted in ascending order.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
arr: An array of integers.

-----Output-----
The output is an array of integers:
Returns a new array containing all elements from the input array, sorted in ascending order.
